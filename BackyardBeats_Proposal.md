Backyard Beats was conceived to address the unique challenges faced by Malawian musicians in gaining visibility and connecting with audiences in the digital age. Malawi's music scene is rich with diverse genres including Afrobeat, hip-hop, reggae, and traditional folk music, yet local artists struggle to reach beyond their immediate communities.

The platform takes its name from the concept of discovering hidden musical gems in local "backyards" - the districts and communities where authentic Malawian music originates. By creating a digital space that celebrates and promotes local talent, Backyard Beats aims to preserve cultural heritage while providing economic opportunities for artists.

### 1.2 Project Vision

To become Malawi's premier music discovery platform, fostering a vibrant ecosystem where artists can thrive, fans can discover authentic local music, and the nation's cultural identity is celebrated globally.
